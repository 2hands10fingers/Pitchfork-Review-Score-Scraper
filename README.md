# Pitchfork-Review-Score-Scraper

Scrapes all the album reviews on Pitchfork.com by page number. Default is 1 page with 12 reviews.

12 reviews each page.

Now comes with command line arguments:
```
-p [integer] : Scrapes the designated amount of pages.
--csv        : Saves results to a CSV

```

Notes:

- A bit slow, really. Need to figure out how to make it faster.

Future editions:
- Faster?
- Generate averages?


Thank you,
