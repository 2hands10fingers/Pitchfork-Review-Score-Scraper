# Pitchfork-Review-Score-Scraper

Scrapes all the album reviews on Pitchfork.com by page number. Default is 1 page with 12 reviews.

12 reviews each page.

To scrape more than 1 page:
`python pitchfork-scraper.py -p [integer]`

Notes:

- A bit slow, really. Need to figure out how to make it faster.

Future editions:

- Faster?
- Export to CSV with command line arguments
- Generate averages?


Thank you,
